Each native leader and visitor owns the belongings in his box on the Setup Card, and he always has these belongings with him, ready to trade (his methods for transporting these belongings are not represented in the game). Natives and visitors also have an unlimited amount of gold to spend (this gold is not recorded anywhere, it just appears when they buy something)."

Any boons he accepts or repays affect the character's trading relationships. Controlled monsters cannot trade with native leaders or visitors."
