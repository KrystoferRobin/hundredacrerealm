            "To construct the map, he puts the Borderland down as the first tile and shuffles the remaining tiles and puts them in a pile. Then he takes each tile in turn from the top of the pile and adds it to the map as explained in step 2 under PREPARE FOR PLAY.",
            "He must always take the top tile in the pile and add it to the map, if it can be placed within the restrictions explained under step 2 of PREPARE FOR PLAY. Special: If it is a Woods or Valley tile, he cannot put it next to another Woods or Valley tile if any other placement is possible. If no other placement is possible, he can put it next to another Woods or Valley tile.",
            "If he cannot place the tile legally, he puts it at the bottom of the pile and takes the next tile.",
            "If the last tile cannot be placed, the player picks up the map and starts all over again.",
            "When all twenty tiles have been placed he selects his character, places the visitor/mission chits and selects his Victory Requirements normally. He must meet his victory requirements normally to win the game.",
            "One of the most interesting aspects of solitaire play is working out the style of play that best suits each character. Different characters have very different styles of play, and it takes several playings to learn their subtleties. Note: Some characters rely on advantages in diplomacy that vanish in solitaire play. It is recommended that these characters be given the optional abilities explained in optional Rule 10.A.6.",
            "The player can take several characters as explained in as explained in optional Rule 10.E.4 below, but all of his characters must win for him to win.",
            "The player does not turn up the chits in the Valley tiles. These chits remain face down and secret at the start of a solitaire game. The Dwellings and Ghosts in the Valley tiles will appear like campfires, when their chits are turned up during the game.",
            "The player starts the game by moving onto the map along any road that runs from the edge of the map to the Borderland. His first activity must be a Move activity to enter the map. Note: If the player starts a new character after his old character is killed, the new character enters the map along the same roadway that the original character used.",
            "The player plays the game normally, except that two rows of denizens are prowling each day, and both rows can appear and move on the map. At Sunrise the player rolls twice and puts a Monster Roll chit in each row he rolls (using an extra chit to represent the second Monster Roll chit). If he rolls doubles, he puts both chits in the same row and that is the only row that prowls.",
            "The optional rules are highly recommended for solitaire players who are familiar with the game. These rules add diversity that enhances a solitaire game. In particular, the optional combat rules add a charming uncertainty to individual battles."

His Special Advantages are numbered \"1\", and \"2\" on the List of Characters; when he starts at (or reaches) second or third level he gets the Advantage numbered \"1\", and when he starts at (or reaches) fourth level he gets both Special Advantages. When he starts at first level, he has no Special Advantages. Example: At first level, the Dwarf does not get the Short Legs and Cave Knowledge advantages (his youthful energy offsets his short legs).",
            "Each character gets his trading relationships at his third level â€“ he gets these trading relationships only if he starts the game at his third or fourth level. If he starts at first or second level, all of the natives and visitors start the game Neutral to him.",
            "When a player records the Dwelling where his character will start the game, he also records his character's starting level. When he puts his character counter on the map, he announces his character's level. Reducing his character's level reduces the number of Victory Points he assigns to his Victory Requirements. Each level is worth one Victory Point (regardless of the length of the game), so if he starts two levels lower than normal he records two fewer Victory Points at the start of the game. Exception: A character must always record at least two Victory Points, regardless of the level he starts at or the length of the game.",

Each time he gains a certain number of points towards fulfilling his Victory Requirements, he gains one of the action chits listed for his next development level. He can choose which chit to take. When he has obtained all three of the chits that belong to his next level, he advances to that level.",

            "The character's Great Treasures, and the Fame and Notoriety values of his belongings, count towards his development. He gains a Victory Point only when his Victory Point total increases: if he loses points, he must regain the lost points before he can progress towards his next chit. A Victory Point counts towards his development only if it counts towards his Victory Requirements. Example: If he assigns 3 points to Gold, only the first 90 Gold points he gets counts towards his development.",
            "Once a character gains a chit, he keeps it and can use it normally in the game thereafter. When he completes his second level he gains his first Special Advantage, and when he completes his fourth level he gains his second Special Advantage. Gaining levels does not change his weapons, armor, spells and trading advantages; these change only as a result of the normal events of the game."

            "A character must record and acquire extra Victory Points for his excess stages of development, so a seventh-stage character needs eight points to win.",
            "The players will find that games can end quickly when some of the players are at low stages; when a game ends too quickly the characters can leave the board setup, move to the start of the next lunar month and start the next game from there.",
            "Option: Because it is difficult for lower stage characters to acquire Victory Points, Extended Development games may be played where the characters are not required to select Victory Requirements at the beginning of the game. Victory Points of any kind acquired during the game entitle the character to earn an extra chit as in Rule E.5.4. Any Victory Points lost will have to be regained before a character can qualify for the next extra chit, and negative Victory Points (negative Fame or Notoriety divided by 10 or 20 and rounded down â€“ no x3 penalty) must be compensated for by a greater number of positive Victory Points to earn a chit. The winner of each game is the character who has gained the most extra chits at the end of the agreed-upon game length. A longer-term goal can also be established, such as the first character to reach 5th level, regardless of the number of games required to reach that goal."
