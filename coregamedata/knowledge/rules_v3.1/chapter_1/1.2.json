  "title": "ORGANIZATION OF THE RULES",
  "content": "Sections 2, 3, and 4 bring together all the Second Edition rules related to game pieces, game set up, and game mechanics. General rules relating to treasures and magic are found here; discussions of specific treasures, items, spells, and wishes/curses are found in the Lists and Tables section. Section 5 is a detailed list of the sequence of play, suitable for reproducing as a double-sided reference sheet. The rest of the rules are organized in order of the Sequence of Play: Section 6 Birdsong and Sunrise, Section 7 Daylight activities, Section 8 Evening activities (including Combat), and Section 9 Ending the Game and scoring. Optional rules, organized by topic, follow the basic rules. The List and Tables sections has been expanded, and now contains all statistics for weapons, armor, horses, natives, monsters, and characters that are needed to play the game.\n\nTo reference a question on play, you can turn to the section of the game related to the event in question and find all the rules collected together. Alternatively, you can look up the subject in the Index, which lists the references to a topic in every stage of play. Because it contains all the details needed to play the game in full, the primary use of the Third Edition Rules is as a complete reference for those who already know the rudiments of play. Beginners should look at the next section for advice on getting started in the Realm.",
