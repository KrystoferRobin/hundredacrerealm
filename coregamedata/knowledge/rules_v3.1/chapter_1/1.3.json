  "content": "If you are just beginning to play Magic Realm, here are some suggestions. Since the Third Edition Rules are compatible with the Second Edition Rules (which can be downloaded from the web at any of the sites listed in the reference section below) you can begin your journey into the Magic Realm by first playing the First Encounter and then the Second Encounter from the Second Edition Rules. The Board Setup and Prepare for Play sections are essentially identical between the editions. The First Encounter presents all the elements of play related to treasure hunting and the Second Encounter introduces combat with monsters. Hired natives, combat between characters, and between characters and natives are introduced in the Third Encounter. The rules for magic are contained in the Fourth Encounter.\n\nBecause the structure of the Third Encounter of the Second Edition Rulebook is particularly confusing, after playing the Second Encounter several times the novice player is well-advised to switch to the Third Edition Rules. Note that there are some changes to the rules on monster appearance, blocking, following, and exchanging items between the first two Encounters and the Third Encounter. These changes are highlighted in the Summary of the Third Encounter of the Second Edition Rules. This section, as well as the next two sections on \"Following\" and \"Blocking Characters\" should be reviewed before starting to use the Third Edition Rulebook.\n\nAlternatively, if you prefer to begin with the Third Edition Rules, here are some suggestions for learning the game from this rulebook.\n\n1) Download the rule summary file, The Least You Need to Know to Play Magic Realm from the same web site where you found this Rulebook. This is an eight-page summary of the sequence of play which contains, in a condensed form, the material on Sequence of Play, Daylight activities, and Evening activities from Section 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the Third Edition Rules. Reading through The Least You Need to Know to Play Magic Realm will give you a sense of the play sequence and activities that can be done, and it can serve as a \"cheat sheet\" while playing the game. You will need to follow the instructions in Sections 2, 3, and 4 from the Third Edition Rules to set up the board and prepare for play, and refer to the appropriate sections of the Third Edition for amplified information when questions arise.\n\n2) Play the game without magic, hired natives, or character vs. character combat (approximately equivalent to the Second Encounter of the Second Edition) as a start. You can skip or ignore any reference to Hire phases or Enchant phases in the Daylight Section and to color magic, spell-casting, targeting other characters, and hired natives in combat in the Evening. Spell cards do not need to be set up, and magical items and artifacts can be treated as inert items with the listed Fame, Notoriety, and Gold prices. When using this variant, select your characters from among those that are recommended for the first two Encounters in the Second Edition list of characters (magic-using characters will be very adversely affected if the use of spells is ignored!) After you have some confidence in the game at this level, add the rules on hired natives and character vs. character combat and play a game or two (approximately equivalent to the Third Encounter). Finally add the rules on magic.\n\n3) Allow all beginners to play the first game (or the first week or two of the first game) without pre-recording moves. When taking their turns, they can do any activities allowed in each of their phases without being restricted to following orders written down during Birdsong. In essence, each beginner plays as if he had the Timeless Jewel in his possession.\n\nJoel Yoder has written a paragraph-form rulebook, Magic Realm in Plain English, which is essentially equivalent to the Second and Third Edition rulebooks. Many beginning players have found this a useful alternative to the more \"legalistic\" style of the numbered rules in the Second and Third Edition rulebooks. You can find Magic Realm in Plain English available to download for free on the Magic Realm page on Boardgamegeek:\n\nhttp://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/22\n\nFinally, if you can play with someone who already knows the game, it will make this jump-start into Magic Realm much easier! You may find play-by-e-mail games oriented towards beginners advertised in the web references below.",
