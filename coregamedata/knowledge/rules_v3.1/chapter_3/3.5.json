The map chits are placed secretly and randomly, and at the start of the game they are face down so that no one knows what is in each tile. The Site chits represent treasure sites, six of the Warning chits are exchanged for Dwellings, and the other Warning and Sound chits identify areas visited by monsters. The Lost City chit represents five secret map chits placed in the Lost City section of the Setup Card, and the Lost Castle represents five secret chits placed in the Lost Castle section. When one of these chits is revealed, its five chits are put in its tile, face up."
